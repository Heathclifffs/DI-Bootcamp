Take a look at this link for help.

The point of this challenge is to display a list of two books on your browser.

In the body of the HTML page, create an empty div:
<div class="listBooks"></div>
In the js file, create an array called allBooks. This is an array of objects. Each object is a book that has 4 keys (ie. 4 properties) :
title,
author,
image : a url,
alreadyRead : which is a boolean (true or false).

Initiate the array with 2 books of your choice (ie. Add manually 2 books objects in the array)
Requirements : All the instructions below need to be coded in the js file:
Using the DOM, render the books inside an HTML table (the HTML table must be added to the <div> created in part 1).
For each book :
You have to display the book’s title and the book’s author.
Example: HarryPotter written by JKRolling.
The width of the image has to be set to 100px.
If the book is already read. Set the color of the book’s details to red.
