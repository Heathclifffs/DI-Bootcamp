Prompt the user for a number to begin counting down bottles.

In the song, everytime a bottle drops,
the subtracted number should go up by 1.
For example,

    We start the song at 99 bottles
    -> Take _1_ down, pass it around
    -> we have now 98 bottles

    -> then, Take _2_ down, pass them around
    -> we have now 96 bottles

    -> then, Take _3_ down, pass them around
    -> we have now 93 bottles

    ... ect


3. The song should end with “0 bottle of beer on the wall” or “no bottle of beer on the wall”.


4. Note : Make sure you get the grammar correct.

For 1 bottle, you pass “it” around.
For more than one bottle, you pass “them” around.
